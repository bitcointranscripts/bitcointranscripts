## INTRO

Christian: Before I start, it's probably a good idea to make sure you have a Lightning wallet downloaded because at the end, I have some games we can play and actually get some Bitcoin through the games. So if you haven't got a Lightning wallet installed, please do so. I recommend my company's wallet, Zebedee. So if you just type in Zebedee on my t-shirt into the Google Play or App Store, you should be able to download it. But today, yeah, today I'm gonna talk about the history of Bitcoin in gaming. Okay, cool. So I've been told that, like, people here are kind of somewhat Bitcoin familiar. Is anybody here who's completely new to Bitcoin? Don't be shy. But everybody kind of knows what it is, so I don't have to explain the basics. Yeah, so yeah, I thought I'd just give an interesting presentation on the history of Bitcoin in gaming, or the history of gaming with Bitcoin. Because at the moment, actually, blockchain in gaming is actually quite a buzzword. I went to a gaming conference just last week and there's like a blockchain track but there's really no mention of Bitcoin. But it actually all kind of started on Bitcoin with gaming and I was there in 2013 I started to make Bitcoin games. But yeah, I just want to give the context. I think it's interesting so people kind of know how it started, what kind of went wrong, and what's getting better now with Zebedee and Lightning. Yeah, so before I start, I just want to go 

## Money in games

Christian: back way before even Bitcoin. And games had money. Does anybody know what these cards are? Has anybody seen them before? No? Nobody seen them before?

Audience: Are these tarot cards? 

Christian: No, no, no. These are called Hana Fuda, which is Japanese for flower cards. And Originally in Japan, the first kind of Western people to come to Japan were I think the Portuguese and they basically brought kind of card games to Japan and people would basically play games for money. You know, games had money. You know, obviously kids would play games without money but most people, they would make a game more interesting with some money. That's just what made sense. However, eventually, I think the Shogun, they actually banned it because obviously putting games in money a bit too much, you have these issues with gambling, stuff like this, and the Japanese shogun didn't like it. So they actually banned it. And a company, a very old company, made these cards. And the point of these cards were that they didn't look like normal playing cards. They were kind of a secret way to play games with money, because people just look them up. They're just like, you know, just flower cards. They're just interesting images. And yeah, so that's kind of an interesting little bit of a tidbit, because this actually has relevance to one of the biggest gaming companies nowadays, which is this game. Everybody knows this game? So this game is made by what company? Nintendo. So Nintendo made Super Mario, but when Nintendo started, the first game they made were flower cards. So Nintendo was originally kind of a company to make these cards so people could play games, for money, without kind of being, I suppose, beheaded. 

Audience: *Inaudible*

Christian: Yes, yeah, yeah. Well, kind of, yeah. The game itself is kind of boring. I've played it with my wife a few times, so money definitely makes it more interesting. But yeah, but the point is that games had money, and then we kind of had digital games came, right? So we kind of had money in games, but we didn't. So obviously, Nintendo, they wanted to continue the concept of, well, you have a game and you get coins. But obviously when they released Super Mario, you couldn't actually get money. Like, how can you have money in a game? But yet they could still just get, like, fake coins. But this connection between money and games just, you know, seemed obvious. And then we also had Space Invaders, or insert 25 cents to play, so you could put money in a game, but the money wasn't in the game. So when games became digital, the link between games and money kind of broke, just because from a technological reason, right? We had cash and then we had digital things, but we didn't have digital money yet. You know, skip forward like a few decades and yeah, we kind of had money in games, so you know, some companies cropped up like PayPal or in-app purchase and Apple. So yeah, we can kind of put money in games, but it wasn't really, it wasn't really done well, you know, it wasn't like if we play cards, we play poker, we can just like throw some coins to each other, we can pass it around. They couldn't really do that. Instead you would have like, you know, buy some in-game coins for 2.99, 4.99, and you couldn't do a tiny amount. You could only do, you know, whatever a credit card would allow you to do. If you wanted to get money out of the game, you know, There are companies where you would have to basically, you play a game, you earn some money, and then you would have to go through PayPal, but you'd have to wait until you earned a certain amount and it would take ages to go through and you'd need a bank account, it wasn't allowed in some countries, et cetera, et cetera. And then we also had downloadable content. So yeah, this is kind of how money in games kind of became and you know I put it to you that this is kind of not how money in game should work You know money in game should work how money works in you know, how cash works, you know, be peer-to-peer and easily tradable Yeah, so money wasn't programmable, you know. Maybe they would have liked to do that, but the technology wasn't there, you know. And, yeah, so this is from, is it Zoolander? You know, where it's like a famous scene where they're told the files are in the computer. So they look inside the computer. So this is kind of the money's in the computer, but it's not really there. It's not really programmable. But then along comes 

## Initial Bitcoin games

Christian: Bitcoin. I just say Bitcoin there because I had a friend who keeps calling it Bitcorn. So we've all got a friend like that. Yeah and for the first time you know money became programmable in game so this is you know I was the first kind of Bitcoin client was like was it 2010 or the client came out where you can actually start to use it in applications. So you know. 

Audience: So why did you do the rbtc? (referring to on-screen image of 'r/btc' instead of 'r/bitcoin', different (sub-reddits)[reddit.com])

Christian: Oh I didn't, rbitcoin, sorry. Should I? I agree. This is what happens when you make presentation on the train to Google as the Wi-Fi was going in and out. Magic internet money. This is the one that loaded. Anyway, so yeah, we finally had programmable money and we kind of had the initial Bitcoin games that came out. So I'm not sure people might remember this one I think Adam might know this one. This is Satoshi's Dice. This is a very simple kind of dice game where you would send Bitcoin to an address to place a bet and then it would kind of roll a dice and if you won you get Bitcoin sent back. So this was kind of the first proto game. It also kind of had a game, this was a Bitcoin faucet. I kind of see this a little bit of a game. It's just a way to kind of programmatically, in an application, use Bitcoin as money. So this was, I think, yeah, this was, was this Gavin Andreessen's? I can't remember, but you get five Bitcoins per visitor. I think it used to be more than that at some point, but yeah. Yeah. So this is kind of, you know, what not really games I suppose, but people were starting to kind of figure out, hey, we have programmable money now, so we can actually bring it into the digital world. Any others? I just wondered if anybody knows of any other original Bitcoin games? 

Audience: I think there was a Pok√©game in the initial... Oh yeah, the initial client. 

Christian: Oh, okay, yeah, you might be right, actually, yeah. 

Audience: It wasn't completed, but it did actually work. Yeah, there is some HTML. It looks like something made by Easter. Yeah, yeah. But there is a game. 

Christian: Yeah, I'm sure, like, Obviously, I think there were probably people who made some poker games and stuff like this, but this is probably the first ones that were kind of, I guess, well played. And then we had some other Bitcoin games. So I'm going to plug myself. A lot of these games are my games, because I'm somewhat known for... I started to make Bitcoin games in 2013. And one of the first people to make games on mobile, and actual games that you could download and play. So here are a few. We had like Sarutobi, Takara, I'll get into a bit. There was another game I made. There's also a Minecraft server called BitQuest. This is like 2013, 14, 15. People started to actually make real games. There were a lot of restrictions at the time, especially gaming was really on mobile then, and also on certain like Steam and stuff like that. So it wasn't really allowed, but you know we kind of got ways to do it and I think that's why Minecraft was somewhat open so people could do it. So we started to have games that were coming 

## Sarutobi

Christian: out. I'll talk about the game that kind of started my whole career really. This was a game I made in 2013. I wanted to, I just heard about Bitcoin, went down the rabbit hole and at the time I was like just making an indie game and I thought okay I've got Bitcoin it'll be great in my game I can let people buy things for Bitcoin, you know, so they can buy power-ups for Bitcoin I submitted it to Apple and they basically said no you have to use in-app purchases You can't use you can't just you know use Bitcoin so they had that clear rule, but I just like you know I think I was You know listening to an Andreas podcast and he was like saying, do your hobby with Bitcoin, how you can contribute to Bitcoin. So I just really wanted to shoehorn Bitcoin into this game. So I did something stupid, which was instead of the game getting Bitcoin from the player, the game would give the Bitcoin player. I had no idea how I would fund it. So I just made the mechanism that if you download this game, the game would give you Bitcoin. And I went on Reddit. I posted a QR code and said, send Bitcoin to this address. And all the Bitcoin you send to this address will kind of be sent to players. And at the time, this had actually quite kind of blew up because at the time, people were trying to get everybody to know about Bitcoin, but there were no applications. So finally, people could say to their friends and family, download this game, you can just get Bitcoin, it's easy, and it really showcased how to use it. So people actually sent a lot of Bitcoin to that address and a shrewd me would have run away with the money a long time ago. But I didn't, I stuck with it. So here are some images you would kind of play. And the first version, It would just randomly, it was very crude, it would randomly just throw a hundred bits at you. This is when bits were like the cool term to use before we say SATs. And here's a screen of how it kind of worked. There was a pot. I did a partnership with Zappo. I'm not sure they're around anymore. But they were like an early exchange and they had this cool way, like you could enter your Bitcoin address if you wanted to, but if you didn't have a Bitcoin wallet, a user could download the game, enter their email address and you know, whenever they got Bitcoin, they get an email from Zappos saying, sign up to get your Bitcoin. So it's kind of an easy way to onboard it. A funny story about this. Around the time, there was a hack by Bitstamp. An exchange got hacked. And the hacker actually sent some of the Bitcoin he hacked to the game to be distributed to players. So there's a Coindesk article about how the game was Robin Hood kind of money laundering. I kind of got in touch with them and I offered to give, it wasn't that much, you know, like a few thousand dollars, But I wanted to kind of say hey, I'll give you the money back but bitstamp. I know it's cool Don't worry about it, you know, but I thought it's a nice little story, you know how yeah, I was a Money launderer for a short time of a few thousand dollars. So luckily luckily maybe the hacker knew not to put too much that I wouldn't get in trouble. Yeah so this was like a popular game at the 

## TAKARA

Christian: time. I then went on to make this game. Like the reason I talk about my games is there weren't actually that many games around at the time. I was quite lucky. I often say if you can't be talented, be early. So I was early. So I made a bunch of semi-OK games and kind of got a lot of market share. This was a game I made for Takara. Takara is Japanese for treasure. I was in Japan at the time. I was at a Bitcoin meetup at the Austrian embassy. And do you know when you get a little bit drunk and you think you see coins on the floor, but they're actually bottle caps? I got like that. And I thought, OK, well, it's a bottle cap. But wouldn't it be cool if I could just drop Bitcoin on the floor for people to pick up? So I actually, yeah, I came up with this idea, OK, I'll make a geocaching app. I think it's like 2015 maybe, where people can drop Bitcoin anywhere around the world. And that's what people did. So we can see this is images of Tokyo, like amounts of Bitcoin people drop. So I think we can probably see here how much they dropped. Yes like 2,000 bits. Yeah 0.1 point you know. So people were dropping Bitcoin all around the world and people would collect it. Quite a few businesses picked this up they would they realized we can drop Bitcoin in our restaurant or our cafe and this was kind of secured because if, if anybody knows anything about geocaching games, it's quite easy to fake your location. So this is actually secured. When you drop Bitcoin, you would have to put like a location-based question. So if I drop Bitcoin here, it would be like, what's the Wi-Fi password of this place? So someone would have to come here and type in the Wi-Fi password. So restaurants were kind of doing this. They would drop kind of Bitcoin and then they'd say ask the staff for the code. But people would go there and get the code. So it was really, really quite fun. And also have some people might notice there's things other than Bitcoin there, which I'll get into a little bit. But that was another game I did. And 

## NTFs

Christian: then the next thing in Bitcoin gaming. So we had these mobile games that came out. We had like Minecraft server. And it was starting to take off. There were quite a few companies that were starting to kind of be funded and actually build their games on Bitcoin. And also, this is quite interesting, game tokens on Bitcoin. So I put the word NFTs. They weren't called NFTs at the time, but everybody knows what an NFT is nowadays, right? So yeah, NFTs is a recent term, I think, coined by CryptoKitties. But before, people were, the precursor to NFTs, people were actually minting or issuing tokens as game items and as collectibles on Bitcoin using a protocol called Counterparty. Has anybody heard of Counterparty? Yeah. Yeah. 

Audience: Rare Pepe. 

Christian: Yeah. Okay. So, Rare Pepe. So, Counterparty originally was, I think the  original founders, they wanted to do I guess DeFi on Bitcoin. So it was really marketed more at issuing company stocks and all those kind of shares. But the community said, we're not interested in that. We're interested in doing rare Pepe's on it. But yeah, for the time, we actually started to play around with issuing game items. So this is a game, Spells of Genesis. And it's kind of like the first game ever to really use NFTs. And it's like a Hearthstone-style game. So you'd have these cards, but the cards were provably rare because they were on the blockchain. And then in my game, I let people bring the cards in. So this was the idea of you would have a game item from one game, but because it's on the blockchain, you could use it in another game. So kind of this cross-game item now is kind of known as the metaverse. Yeah, and this is kind of where gaming on Bitcoin started to take off. I think there was an episode of Shark Tank America where a company got funded by Vinnie Lingham to make a counterparty game called Augment Earth. So yeah, it was really starting to take off and you know, this was like, yeah this is the future. 

Audience: I just want to ask about this game and like these cards. I don't know anything about RSO, I know it's based on cards. Like mechanically, how are the cards used in the Spells of Genesis games, or within an application itself, or the game itself? 

Christian: Yeah. So interestingly, what Spells of Genesis did, what the company did, they actually made the game first. So they made the cards first, so the game was still being developed. So originally, the first use case of the tokens were in my game. So actually, so I kind of, because I kind of saw they have a bunch of users who have bought these tokens and they wanted to use it. So I just quickly put them into my game. But in their game, How it would work is you would basically have a wallet, a counterparty wallet, which is basically like a Bitcoin wallet. It even has the same address format. It would hold your Bitcoin. It would also hold your tokens. And then you would link the wallet to the game. You would do something called message signing, where you would basically sign a message to prove you had an address. So the game would have an address, you prove you own the address, and then the game could see what tokens were on that address. So if you had Satoshi card, it would grant you access to Satoshi card in that game. And if you didn't, obviously you couldn't do it. So that's kind of how it works. So in a way it was kind of nice because you didn't actually have to send the token to the game. You know, you keep it in your wallet, you know, so it's kind of scalable in that way, but it had issues which I'll get into. 

Audience Respone: Can you put that back in because I've been trying to use my Sarutobi card. 

Christian: Yeah, well, I'll probably get into like what happened, like why it kind of stopped. So yeah, I did have this at one point and yeah, I plan to bring it back soon. We have something cool we're working on at Zebedee, which I can't talk about because it's all Hush Hush secret, but yeah we do have an a like there's a lot of things wrong with NFTs and there's a lot of ways you should and shouldn't do it but it's ever D this is maybe I'll come back when once that's public and give a talk on that but yeah at some point it will come back But this is like really early stuff. It's kind of like, it reminds me of, I don't know if it's true, but I heard Blockbuster tried to make Netflix like in 1999 or something, or very early on. It was like, just didn't work. The tech wasn't there and there's so many things wrong. But now Netflix really works, right? And Blockbuster's gone. So I kind of see this stuff, you know, it's like so early. It was kind of cool, but it wasn't really the best way to do it. The tech wasn't there. It was a bit early. But yeah, hold on to that Sartutobi card, I suppose. Maybe it'll be useful. 

## Scaling wars - Fee surge

Christian: Yeah, anyway, so not so fast. So everything was great. We had Bitcoin games. People were tipping and dropping Bitcoin everywhere people playing Minecraft We had tokens game items and what could go wrong, right? You know, everything's great Yeah, and this happened fees scaling So probably a lot of people have probably got into Bitcoin after the scaling debate. But Bitcoin had a civil war where people were building applications on Bitcoin. But it didn't really scale. I don't want to get into the whole scaling debate, but loosely, to keep a blockchain decentralized, you have to have a limit on the amount of traffic you can do. The whole thing about Bitcoin is it should be reasonable for people to run their own node and reasonable for miners to kind of mine. But if there's too much traffic on the Bitcoin blockchain it centralizes that because it becomes too expensive to do so. Anyway, there was a big debate and we had this term small blockers and big blockers. And I've got a few images here. So this is when I guess I started to make my game and fees were zero pretty much. And then once my game started to become popular, in order to like, in order to send somebody a 10 cent tip, I had to pay $5 or ¬£5, right? So my game mechanics broke and people who were trading the counterparty assets, people would trade them on a DEX where you could basically sell the image really good. But then once it became like a few dollars to kind of post a bid on the deck. It kind of killed it because you would try to sell a rare Pepe that was worth $5 and it would cost $1 to list it and then it might not get picked up. So it kind of, kind of died in a way. I'm gonna mention this guy. 

Audience: You can use the remote to show. 

Christian: Oh yes I can. This guy, so who's this guy? 

Audience: Luke Dash Jr.

Christian: Luke Dash Jr So he was actually against people who were using the Bitcoin blockchain by I guess what is kind of known as spam. So kind of doing these small transactions which weren't really Bitcoin. So Luke is kind of a small blocker, I think he wants like 300 kilobyte blocks at the time. But people like me were filling the blocks with basically data just for my game, you know. But I also found it a bit hypocritical because, actually no, sorry I got this wrong, he wasn't putting it in the block but he was putting Catholic verses in the Bitcoin so maybe he was kind of filling it up himself. That's true, that's true, But it's kind of like, yeah. And this is kind of like the OP_return war. So OP_return is a way you can add metadata to a Bitcoin transaction. Probably not what, yeah, not sure if that was the original use case, but it let you, it basically lets you build these protocols like counterparty to issue NFTs, it's called OpReturn and I think the Bitcoin devs made it smaller, the amount of data you could put in, but ultimately it was like you know this is kind of an attack on Bitcoin right? Bitcoin, the base layer shouldn't be for applications, it should be for Bitcoin, and then we can use layer twos that didn't exist at the time to kind of build your applications. Yeah, so I actually started as a big blocker, so once my game started to suffer I was like we need to make the blocks bigger and I was a big fan of Bitcoin classic I think you know so but then I had a moment when I realized if my game which wasn't it was popular in the Bitcoin world but it wasn't popular compared to a real game. And so if my game can like fill up some of the blocks, like it's just stupid. Like imagine if at the time I think like Flappy Bird was popular, like something had millions of transactions. Imagine if that we just, it just wouldn't work. So I quickly actually became I guess a small blocker or a pro layer two person. Yeah, but this is basically kind of killed all my games. I didn't mind so much because I kind of built all the games myself. I didn't have any staff to pay. So I just kind of said, oh well, you know, it's what it is. It was a fun ride. But I did have colleagues who had started a company and were paying staff who were quite upset by it. Yeah. 

## Gaming on Ethereum

Christian: And solution. Luckily, my contemporaries at the time, they actually saw a solution, which is this guy. Yes. Well, maybe not. But yeah. But this is what happened. So I was making games on Bitcoin, a bunch of other people were making games, other companies, and then Bitcoin fees too expensive, run away, this new chain has zero fees. And I remember this being discussed, like, I can't remember who it was, but some famous Bitcoin person who was, he actually had like played golf with Vitalik or something, and like, oh, we're moving to Ethereum, like, you know, the fees are low and the fees will always be low. 

Audience: Are you playing golf? 

Christian: Oh, no, it may be with somebody from consensus. But yeah, yeah. But yeah, all these conversations were happening. They were basically saying, it has zero fees, and Bitcoin has a few dollars. But if anybody knows now, that's not the case. And I think they tried to justify it that the culture in Ethereum was such that if the blocks ever got big, they would make the blocks bigger, which is, it's not that simple the way Ethereum works because they actually have a scaling bottleneck before the block size. But also, because the blocks happen every 10 seconds, it would just be great. So yeah, everybody but me, I think, ran away to Ethereum. And I kind of said at the time, they were kicking the can down the road, right? You haven't solved anything. This restaurant's too busy, so let's go to a less popular restaurant. It's kind of what they did. Yeah, So this was me on lonely Bitcoin Island. And everybody was in Ethereum City. So we saw to see CryptoKitties, which broke Ethereum. It's kind of the one game. And we had some other ones, and Axie Infinity, which I think was riddling on Ethereum, but now they've kind of made their own chain. And it's a bit of a castle made of sand, I thought. Yeah, but yeah, I was there, just like, all by my lonesome. And I'm gonna play devil's advocate a bit here. I said that people went over to Ethereum because the fees were lower. It's probably not entirely true. I think there were other two reasons. One is, if you wanted to make applications on Bitcoin, the community wasn't really behind you because they didn't want people making random applications on layer one. So there's a lot of kind of, if you went on Reddit and say, hey, I'm making this on Bitcoin, you kind of get attacked. So I guess there was more of a nicer culture on Ethereum, where you can do whatever you want and there'd be no consequences. Another reason people liked Ethereum is perhaps a smart contracting language, you could actually do more. So Bitcoin NFTs were limited. You couldn't just write random smart contracts. But I think on Ethereum, people could write a smart contract to do an ICO and make lots of money. So that was also appealing as well. But I think the catalyst for it was probably the fees, because people were actually building stuff on Bitcoin to try and do these type of things. Counterparty was actually making an EVM as well to do smart contracts. But just the fees meant there's no point doing it. So yeah, but just to play a little bit of devil's advocate, it wasn't entirely the thesis. 

Audience: Fees were more the inbuilt tokenization, you mentioned ICO as well, and I feel like maybe it was more that. 

Christian: Well, I'm just saying, I did, like I know people who went to Ethereum and it was the fees that were the catalyst. But definitely, the being able, one thing that meant tokens, the ERC20 took off on Ethereum was because on Counterparty, it was very, very hard to sell your token. There was no way to kind of do it, right? If you issued a token, how do you sell that? You basically, you know, like with ERC-20, you send money to an address and the smart contract sends you the token. It kind of runs itself as it were, like the Ethereum blockchain is your server for you. With Counterparty, You could list it on a DEX and people could buy it. There was a company called Tokenly which made a swap bot, which was a centralized server where they would basically, you'd send them your tokens and people would send them Bitcoin, and then they would distribute it for you. But It wasn't as easy as just deploying a smart contract. We're going to make this thing, we promise, send all your money here and we'll give you this token. Yeah. So I think that's another reason why it took off as well. That's why I'm being a good researcher here and playing devil's advocate. 

## Gaming on Lighting Network

Christian: Yeah. But I wasn't alone on the island. I saw in the far distance a little ship coming very far away with lightning on it. Yeah, so I kind of, around this time, gaming and Bitcoin kind of died. But I kind of thought on Ethereum, it's like, does not really scalable either. So what's the solution here? I did actually a lot of work on research on some side chain stuff in the early days and trying to see what's the best way to do that. I even made Ethereum dApps just to try Ethereum out. I didn't want to criticize it before I tried it out. So I tried it out and made some dApps. I did the original Web3. I made a Web3 wallet when Web3 actually meant something. It had a specific protocol. Now it's more of a nebulous term. I won't get into it, but I saw some of the bottlenecks in a theorem which kind of made me a little bit skeptical of it at the time but yeah so I then I heard about lightning network this seemed like a good idea yeah so I just had to wait around for that basically Anyway so now Bitcoin in gaming is possible. So Lightning Network came. I remember when it was first released I tried it out and it took me about an hour to actually buy a t-shirt because my channel, my payments wouldn't route and so actually to be honest as a game developer when it first came it's like okay it's not really It's not the silver bullet. I hoped for you know that's potential, but it was quite hard to use in a game because I don't get into how lightning works But there's a lot of things you have to worry about which I think I have a slide for. I have a slide about it in a little bit. But yeah, anyway, so now I'm alone on the island, but with lightning. So instead of Bitcoin, it's just me doing lightning pretty much. And then Ethereum City had turned into Blockchain City. So we had all these other kind of chains cropping up like Engine and EOS and stuff like this. So pretty much the gaming community had kind of left Bitcoin. And there weren't coming back because everybody was busy building on blockchain. So it was just me, which is kind of good because it means that I could start a company and have very little competition. But yeah, but then we actually just started to see early lightning gaming. So people might know this one is probably the first lightning game maybe called Satoshi's Place, which was you would, it was basically a public, somebody described it as a public toilet wall. But you would basically pay to paint pixels, right? And so you could draw whatever you wanted to, but you'd have to pay like a sat per pixel. And I think I remember at the Lightning Conference they actually had it behind them on a panel and somebody was drawing a giant penis as they were doing it. You know, but it was kind of cool. It just kind of showed...

Audience: Sorry. When we were showing this in our first meet-up which was about the history of lightning, and actually, it's an interesting fact it's actually still on and still works...*Inaudible* 

Christian: It runs from London doesn't it? Lightning well when I spoke to Lightning Koala, I kept saying like, why is it so slow? And he said, it's running off, it wasn't a Raspberry Pi, but it's running off a Raspberry Pi type thing in his cupboard. Literally, that was how it was. It wasn't on a server. But that, yeah, so I assume, you know, and like when it went down I'd message him, he said, oh and let me just open the cupboard, and I go, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's got overheated or something. Yeah, but it was just showing how it's scalable now. We don't have to worry about, you know, spamming the blockchain, we don't have to worry about fees, we do have to worry about channels, but we can solve that, right? We'll make that a scalable one. And then also Lightning Koala teamed up with Andre Neves to make Koala Studios and they brought out Lightning Chess, which was another kind of a Bitcoin game, which is quite cool. We have Satoshi's Games, who are a little bit controversial at the moment, because they've moved to Solana. So, but, but we can talk about that a bit later. But they actually started to make games as well. And, Donna Lab were another one. I think they made like a Minecraft server with Lightning, then they also made like a first person shooter style game, Bitcoin Bounty Hunt, and also Thnder Games. So Thnder Games, I think Jack comes to the meetups here now and then from Thnder Games. Yeah, They're really cool. They actually accidentally got started at the Lightning Conference. We actually kind of formed our company just before the Lightning Conference. So we had a table and Jack, who I'd spoken to, he kind of just turned up and he noticed the table next to our booth was empty so he just kind of set up shop and said I'm working on this game and you know and people found it quite popular so after that he kind of, okay I'm gonna make this a proper company. Yeah so they're a good company to watch out for. But yeah early you know gaming has started, you know people start to realize it's okay to do it on Lightning, on Bitcoin. And it's actually quite important that the community also encouraged it. So before on Bitcoin, if you'd want to make a game, people were kind of, they would kind of criticise you. You shouldn't be building on Bitcoin. It's not what Bitcoin is for. But Lightning, that culture of, yeah, build what you want. You know, it's OK, started to come back. So it was a lot more encouraged. But Lightning is hard, right? So from a technical point of view, it's still quite hard to use, right? I don't know like, show of hands, how many people run a lightning node here? Okay, probably the wrong meetup to ask out. But, anyway, but you know what I mean, it's kind of like, you know, if you want to just focus on making on game, a game developer, you don't want to have to learn how to maintain a Lightning node. So it's not where a lot with building on-chain, the chain does everything for you a lot of the time. You don't, the chain in a way is your server. But with Lightning, you have to run and manage it yourself. So this concept of channels, if you want to accept Lightning payments, you have to make sure you have these channels set up, which basically just means the payments route correctly. And you have to kind of, it's something that you kind of have to do manually if you want it to work well. There's kind of ways to do it automated. 

Audience: To be fair, it's not as easy as it used to be right? Everyone's got these apps. It's all built in. But I still totally agree with you it. It's more manual. 

Christian: This is like when it first came out as well, right? It was yeah It's like the wallet you download you'd have to open the channel in the wallet where now the the wallets will open a channel for You enough to think about it and there's various things Also, another thing is actually regulation. This is more specific to game developers So not the average user, but if you're a game developer like a proper game developer let's just say like Epic Games or something, and you want to use Bitcoin and Lightning, you know, you have to worry about regulation. Like can you just send your players money? You know, what if somebody tries to use our game for money laundering? So it's kind of, it's just, it adds friction to game developers to use Bitcoin and Lightning. So these kind of things why still we didn't really see too many games coming on Lightning I think. 

## ZEBEDEE

Christian: Also important point, crypto people can't make games. Like I've been in this space long enough and I've made some terrible games and I've just seen like block fighters, block wars, you know, crypto, karate, all these games come out and yeah, it's like we have the technology now but it's kind of hard to use And the people who like the technology don't know how to make games. That's why the first games that came out were made by Bitcoiners. And it kind of showed. So we really needed game developers who know how to make games and don't know anything about Bitcoin to use Bitcoin. But because they don't know anything about Bitcoin, they wouldn't do it. So we kind of had like, the Bitcoin people couldn't make games and the game developers couldn't use Bitcoin. So that was kind of the friction that happened. But then along comes my company to solve it all. So this is Zebedee. This is co-founded by us three. That's Simon Cowell, he's our CEO. He was actually, he contacted me because he was working at Bitstamp at the time, and he just kind of saw that Lightning Network is here. He said working at an exchange, he saw how much liquidity of Bitcoin was out there, but there was nothing to really do with it, and he was kind of into gaming. So he said, well, who do I contact to make Bitcoin games? And again, I was the only person on the island. Not the only person, but you know. And he was actually an original player of Sartutobi in like 2014, 15. I actually have a support email from him where he's like asking me, hey, can we do this or something? So it's kind of, yeah, it's weird how, you know, kind of stuff comes around. Andre Neves, he was from Chaincode Residency. So Chaincode was this company who they basically, I don't know what, they funded Bitcoin development and he also did like a residency where if you were selected you would just go to New York for like a month and just learn from the experts how to make Bitcoin. And he also comes from like a kind of big tech background. And he also made Koala Studios who made the lightning chess. So, you know, And it was me who made games. So we're kind of like the three pillars of like a chair or something. Simon knows business, he comes from the business world. Andre knows kind of tech, he's built stuff for like big companies like Facebook, et cetera. And I know kind of games in a way. So we kind of came together. And before I think Andre tried to get funding for Koala Studios but he wasn't really the business guy. I tried to get funding for my games but I wasn't really a business guy either. And Simon didn't really know anything about gaming anyway. So we all kind of come together to make Zebedee. And I'm gonna go into a little bit what Zebedee is, see what slide, yep. So Zebedee, we basically, our goal is we want to make it easier for game devs to add Bitcoin into their games. So as I mentioned before, there's technical challenges, there's regulatory issues. So we are not a gaming studio. We do have games we have made, but we really, we are making the tools to get the big players like Epic games or something like that to use Bitcoin. So our kind of product suite is we have like an open REST API, which kind of works on all platforms. I'm not going to go too much into the tech details here, but we have a developer dashboard. We have a game server, but we basically have all the tools for a game studio to be able to kind of download an API key and add Bitcoin into the games and they don't have to worry about channels, they don't have to worry about the wallet, you know, because we have a wallet the players can use, you don't have to worry if they're breaking any laws or regulations because we cover all that. So we make it really easy for gamers to add Bitcoin into their games. So this is our wallet as well, which is something we made because we noticed there's a spectrum of Lightning wallets. On one end you have ones which are a bit harder to use but they're non-custodial, you can use them yourself. But our wallet is really targeted not at Bitcoiners, it's targeted at gamers. So we want to kind of get gamers into Bitcoin with the least friction possible. So yeah, it's a consumer wallet. It has a browser extension. So you can use it. You can link it with your Discord. So we have people who play games in our Discord. They can just write, send Chris 10 sats in its scent and it all reflects in the wallet. We have this gamertag concept. So one of the issues with Lightning at the moment is it's kind of too much based around QR codes. You know, QR codes are kind of cool, but in gaming, I'll show in a bit, you know, You kind of don't want to have to be scanning QR codes. Say you're playing a game and you're collecting a coin. You just want that coin, the Bitcoin, to be sent to you. So we have this concept called a gamer tag, where if you download our wallet, it gives you a unique username in a way. And then you can just type, you know, send 10 sats to Dave or whatever, and it's just sent to them. And yeah, this kind of is a thing that makes sense to gamers. Yeah, we have some integrations as well. So I'm going to show a three minute video, which kind of shows like some of the stuff we do and then after that I've got a few more slides and I'm going to kind of get some people to actually play one of our sample games that we made and you can actually get some Bitcoin from it. Okay, I can use this can't I. 

Video: I saw, oh we got an active guard, so wow, we got more than 20 power-ups, so that will kind of mess everybody up. It literally makes it chaotic. We have like tornadoes and things and the drivers hate it but it only lasts about 20 seconds. And we have lightning bolts. So what I'm trying to do here is just trying to kind of show how the audience can interact with the game through Bitcoin. 

Christian: There we go. There we go. Yeah. So some people might have noticed we actually have a Bitcoin integration into CSGO, which is like a massively huge game. I think that peak, they have like 20 million monthly online players. And we added Bitcoin to that just because, as I mentioned before, we're not a gaming company so we can build kind of fun games. We can't build like really AAA games. So we decided it makes sense just to put Bitcoin into a game people already play, but now they'll want to play it more for Bitcoin. And then we can actually go to AAA game studios, which we're doing now, say, look, we had CSGO, we put Bitcoin in it, and the players are now playing more. So you should put Bitcoin into your AAA games. So that's how we get this conversation started. But this is actually some nice stories of people tweeting out stuff they bought playing Zerbity games, mainly CSGO for Bitcoin. So yeah, these are mostly from I think Brazil or like South America. Yeah, but this guy has, he's just bought food so he can eat, you know, he's turned his CSGO playing into food. This person is saying they... Yeah, this person has paid their monthly bills and bought sneakers. So yeah, you know, it's really nice to see that there's kind of like a circular economy happening here. I should point out that the Bitcoin that these people have made on our CSGO, we mainly have sponsored service, so we have people like Bitstamp who are kind of funding it, but you can actually kind of pay to play. So on the one side of pay to play, for every photo of somebody buying something, there's somebody frustrated that they probably lost Bitcoin. But it's kind of nice, you know, I think, you know, you kind of get these young kids in South America taking money from like richer people who aren't as good in America or something. So it kind of like maybe balances out a little bit. But yeah, we actually have servers that are sponsors, so you can play without having to lose anything. Yeah, so we have a few mobile games that you can also try. So this is obviously my game. Oh, yeah. I forgot to mention my game that broke during the scaling debate. I brought it back with lightning. So Sartutobi, you can play now and get Bitcoin. We also have these two from another developer called Vykr. They're kind of like hyper-casual mobile games. So the way these games are funded is the game will show ads like games do but some of the ad revenue the developers are giving back to the players in the form of Bitcoin. Sarutobi probably has the most Bitcoin that we give out. But we also get, yeah, this is a great one we added, who wants to be a millionaire, which kind of makes sense. So people were playing this game and they were kind of like, you know, not getting money. It's a game where you get money. So now you can play this and you can get like sats. So you can get a million sats I guess in a way. You have to play a lot to get that much. But yeah, so these are some mobile games. But if you're more of a professional gamer, you wanna try Counter-Strike CSGO. Yeah, and we have a lot of other games coming onto the platform this year, which you know, I can't mention just yet, but some exciting additions are going to be added. 

## NFTs on Bitcoin

Christian: Yeah, and as the last slide is kind of like an open kind of thing. So obviously I kind of went through how Bitcoin started, with the Bitcoin gaming started with Bitcoin payments and how we were playing around with NFTs in the early days and how Lightning has come and we can have Bitcoin payments on games, but we can't really have NFTs on Bitcoin yet. Really, Lightning does payments well. And that's why Lightning is scalable because it's like a tool, it's focusing on one job, you know, that's why it can do this one job well. Where more general blockchains like Ethereum who want to do smart contracts, because they're trying to do so many things, it's an order of magnitude more difficult to scale. So we're not quite there yet with doing some of this other stuff on Bitcoin. But there are a few ways it's kind of being solved or done at the moment. So we have sidechains which could be a thing on Bitcoin. Maybe I know the next event you'll have Ruben who's going to talk about space chain. So if they ever come, that could be a thing that we are keeping an eye on. RGB is the kind of thing that lets you do tokens on lightning, but not really. I don't know. I think you had a guy, Igor was it, talk about RGB, but I still think that has some limitations because I think to transfer an asset would still take an on-chain transaction, but it's a better approach. Databases are a great way to do, which is an important point on DINOs and databases. So does anyone know what DINO means? It's kind of a new term. 

Audience: Decentralized In Name Only. 

Christian: Yes. Yes. So again, being a little bit of, I'd say, a little bit skeptical, I suppose. We actually- so I said that a lot of people were building on Ethereum, and then as those fees became high, they've moved to other chains. So in my opinion, I don't think it's wrong, but people are solving the scalability issue of game items on a blockchain. By making blockchains which aren't really blockchains, they're making things that are really databases. But they call them a blockchain. So people think that using a blockchain, but then these blockchains go offline, which doesn't really happen. The Lightning Network can't really go offline per se, because it's decentralized. So people are kind of solving it. It's a little bit frustrating at the moment because, again, to be cynical, they're not completely centralized. They seem to be decentralized, they're decentralized enough to avoid regulation, but not decentralized enough that you could actually have like true ownership of your item. But I don't actually think NFTs or game items necessarily have to be super decentralized. This is why I put databases, right? If you're playing a game and the game is centralized anyway and the game gives you an asset that you can kind of trade, I think most gamers in a way when they like NFTs are not particularly bothered about being able to store their NFT on a hardware wallet and validate they have the NFT by their own node. They just like the idea they can have something and they can trade it on a marketplace. So what we're kind of starting to see in this space is a lot of these other chains which are kind of more centralized, giving people the low fees, the marketplace. They don't give them the decentralization, but no one's really complaining about that. So that's probably where it's going. So yeah, like, you know, NFTs on Bitcoin, we could have decentralized NFTs, you know, in the future, but I think for the most gamers aren't too fussed about that. And at Zebedee, we have something interesting we're working on, but we kind of believe that the good thing about Bitcoin is with Bitcoin, because Bitcoin itself is decentralized, if you get Bitcoin in a game, even if it's through a decentralized way, you have a decentralized asset that you can store on your wallet. But yeah, so that's just kind of some like end thought, you know, this is kind of like the horizon where Bitcoin gaming is now and, and the, you know, future questions and issues that might arise. But yeah, probably the next talk, you can ask Ruben about NFTs on space chains. He might give you some interesting ideas. Yeah, and that's all, folks. Any questions for me? Yes. 

## Q&A

Audience: Those little games, the... Yeah, those ones. Yeah. Are they... Are they on the Zebedee app? 

Christian: No, no, you just have to download it on like Play Store or- Yeah, yeah, or, or I- iOS, yeah. I think, I think most of them are on both, but definitely all, all on the Play Store. Yeah, yeah, yes. 

Audience And then you, what, you just punch in your Zebedee? 

Christian: Yeah, so at the moment, all these games at the moment, I think they work through the gamer tags. This is something, you know. So Sarutobi, actually, if you played it, you could actually withdraw the Bitcoin to any Lightning wallet. But at the moment I've limited it so it only pays out to the Zebedee gamertag. So you get sats sent to your Zebedee wallet. You can then send those sats to another Lightning wallet if you want, but yeah you'll need the Zebedee wallet to play. And the reason I did that is for two reasons. One is we've, it's quite interesting, play-to-earn blockchain games are quite popular at the moment and people might be aware that there are these, you know, captures aren't safe anymore, right? If you want to put a capture on your website there are actually APIs you can download which it sends your capture to like a farm in Africa and humans solve it, and then they send back the answer and you basically pay like a penny, but each time that's kind of done. And the same things are cropping up for kind of Bitcoin and play to earn games. So what was happening in these games is that we had, I saw these farms would crop up in like Indonesia and stuff and they were kind of like farming the game and getting all the sats. So we had to make some changes to kind of stop people doing that. And one of the small changes was that they'd had to have a Zebedee wallet, but I'm gonna add support for Lightning in general because we've kind of solved this issue about...

Audience: *Inaudible*

Christian: They can but it's an extra level of friction and also lightning still has fees. If I want to send one sat to a player then if I send it and they have a wallet that goes through a weird route I might have to pay ten sats to send that one sat but with a gamer-tag it's a lot lower but yeah you you're right so once I added that they started to get round Zebedee while they started to farm So now we have... 

Audience: It's good for your numbers, it's good for your stats and your company, right? 

Christian: Yeah, but... 

Audience: You've got 5 million users. 

Christian: This is actually... So this is something we actually did an experiment. So actually, Zebedee, we make games not for our business model. We actually make games to kind of explore and see what are the issues so we can advise other people. So we've noticed this issue with, you know, if you put Bitcoin in a game, people are going to try and farm it and hack it, which they will. So through the Sarutobi we come up with a solution where it's a few ways to do it, but kind of one way to stop it is that when they first play the game you can earn so little that it's not economical to farm it, you know, but as you actually progress as a player and the game knows you're a real person because you know you've actually done stuff that real people do or like a real person will put time and effort in, then you start to earn more and more Bitcoin and that's what kind of what we're doing with Sartutobi and that kind of stopped it because now if a farm starts up they basically they can't get to that level It's not economical for them to get like one sat or something, you know, because they still have to pay humans So that's something we're doing with that game Actually find it quite interesting But it's kind of a new it's you know some of the issues when you put Bitcoin into games is you get, it makes people play a lot more. So we see the users, we see companies who have added us, they see like a 2x in retention, which is massive in the games industry. And the cost per install, the CPI is like 40 cents compared to like four dollars or something. So that's really really good. But obviously the flip side is that you get people trying to make bots to play your game. So that's why we kind of you know. But yeah it's a solvable problem. It's just you know, just need some creative thinking. Yeah, sorry, any more questions? 

Audience: I watched this on CSGO. 

Christian: Yes. 

Audience: Did you do like a plugin or is it a CSGO thing? How does it work? 

Christian: Yeah, it's actually quite an interesting story. I actually wanted to, actually, originally I was working on, I was going to do it for Quake and I went on a Quake modding forum and I wanted to mod Quake because Quake was kind of open source and the administrator said like, you're not trying to mod it to add cryptocurrency to it. If you are, I'll ban you. So in a way, I thought, well, no. But then I thought, well, I don't really have to mod it. What you can actually do with these games is, like CSGO and Quake, they let you run your own server. So when somebody's playing, you can actually see all the traffic that's going on on your server so you know if somebody shot somebody. You know, they just download the legit game from Steam, they join on your server and you can see that Alice shot Dave and then you can just send Alice a sat. So the great thing is you don't even have to mod it. We have added some mods just to make it a bit more fun, like putting actual coins in the game. Yeah, but it's actually really quite interesting and I recommend if anybody's watching this and they want to try and mod another game, there are a bunch of games which let you run a dedicated server. These games, with our API, it's really easy to put Bitcoin into them. Yeah, so. Nice. Okay, so feel free to ask me questions afterwards. Well I actually did come with some games we can actually try. At Zebedee we developed a Mario Kart style game. And you basically play it like Mario Kart and at the end you get sats. So I'll probably end the presentation now and then I'll get that set up and then we can. 

Audience: Can I just ask one more? 

Christian: Yeah, go for it. 

Audience: I didn't know you had a browser extension. What functionality is in that? Because I've only used the mobile wallet. 

Christian: Yeah, it's all the same. So the idea is like the wallet is everywhere you go, right? So if you have, if you download our wallet, you have a Zebedee account. So that Zebedee account, It's in browser, it's in Discord, it's in Telegram as well I think. 

Audience: I've used it in Discord, yeah. 

Christian: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, so yeah. The idea is, yeah, there's everybody everywhere, you know. Because that's how gamers play, right, you know. And, you know, gamers. 

Audience: I mean, does it somehow give the ability, like, if you're on some kind of a web page, I'm not quite sure what kind, to make a payment on the... I'm trying to think what the browser is. 

Christian: Yeah, well obviously it'll support, you know, for example, with some lightning games, if you press a link and it calls an LN URL, the extension would pick that up and pay it, for example. 

Audience: Right, but again, it's in the browser, right? 

Christian: Yeah, yeah, that could be where, it doesn't even have to be a game to say like say you you played a Zebedee say you played Sarutobi and you earned a lot of sats and they were sent to your your wallet then you know you go on to the browser, you're shopping on some Bitcoin website, which is Bitcoin payments to buy gift cards, and then you can actually just pay from your extension, because it's the same account, stuff like that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Audience: And what would you say, because I suspect a lot of people here either haven't used Everdeen before, maybe. What would you say is like the usefulness of it? Is it exclusively if you're a hardcore gamer you're gonna find it useful? Or are there other kinds of users you think might find it useful? 

Christian: So we start, so actually, So we're a gaming company and we started with gamers. So obviously there are lightning companies who are more general payment companies. But at Zebedee, ideally, we'd great to do payments everywhere, but we wanted to be focused, right? We thought it makes more sense to focus on a demographic, gamers, and get that working first. But yeah, we will probably slowly also expand to other types of applications. But yeah, I suppose the wallet is a lightning wallet which kind of works for other things, right? So not just gaming, but eventually we're probably going to bridge to, I think gaming itself is kind of blurring. So things are becoming gamified, right? So we have one studio that is trying to make like a duolingo type thing. It's not really game, But it's like an application where you can learn a language and you get like Bitcoin rewards So in a way, we probably would branch out to more gamified things and then who knows in the future, you know yeah, it's You know sky's the limit I guess but. 

Audience: but since we already discussed this in earlier meetups, the sort of profile of your wallet from a Lightning technical perspective is, to what extent is it custodial or not? Does it support LNURL? Yeah, LNURL stuff, you know, the address and all that stuff. 

Christian: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, so this, again, we are a gaming company first really at the moment, so we wanted to make a wallet which is easy for gamers who don't know about Bitcoin. So it's a custodial gaming wallet. To sign up, you don't need to do any like KYC to start to use and get some sats. You start to get like a lot of sats and stuff and you want to, you know, then we probably you'd have to KYC. 

Audience: But- You still have an email requirement. 

Christian: Yes, or the Discord. However, the games that use the Zebedee platform, you don't have to use the Zebedee wallet to necessarily get the sats. So a gaming company could use our SDK and they could, they support LN URL. So, you know, if the gaming company wants you to use any Lightning wallet you want, that would also be possible. But our wallet also supports LN URL, so if you get sats on our wallet and you don't like that we're custodial, you could send it off to your own wallet, you know, and keep it on your Lightning node. But you can use LN address with it. Lightning address? Yes, so Lightning Address was actually Andre Neves, our CTO, was something that he kind of came up with. Yeah, so we obviously, yeah, we're big promoters of Lightning Address. Yeah, so we're a custodial, but we're an open wallet, if that makes sense. Yeah. 

Audience: I was gonna say that for use case, I actually used the wallet for my website. I wanted to have my donation there. I didn't want to mess with everything, so I just have the LN address and the QR code. It was great for that. It was the easiest solution to set up. 

Christian: Yeah, I think If you download our wallet, you get a profile page which gives you a QR code which lets you accept tips. Again, that's another use case. Outside of gaming, people can use our wallet for tipping. The Lightning address works with Twitter. I think the wallet is a little bit. So our main core function is, we do the APIs and SDK for game developers, but we made a wallet because we want a wallet, we don't want to scare people off. We don't want to scare gamers off with some of the early wallets that, you know, when we first started weren't quite there. But the wallet itself is taking off into kind of a thing of its own which is quite, quite nice to see. Okay. Good. No? All right. Then we play games I guess. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I'm just going to get set up. It'll, it'll take a second but yeah. Yeah. Thank you for having me and it's been great 

## Playing Mario Kart with Bitcoin

Christian: Mario Kart game because most people know how to play it we can actually change the Mario coins to Bitcoin, it's kind of a great way to explain it. And we actually, in Miami last year, we actually had a competition for this game where the race, the winner got half a Bitcoin in prize. Wow. So we actually did that, and I think every month we were doing competitions where we gave away 10 million sats or something from this game. No, today it'll probably bug out and everything because it's being filmed. But yeah, I'll just explain how it'll work and I'm going to host a game and I'll get you guys to join it. I'm going to change this. So this is, I'm Chris. This is my username in here. I'm entering my gamer tag. So this game, you don't have to enter your gamer tag. If you don't enter your gamer tag, I'll show a QR code at the end where you scan to get your sats. If you enter your gamer tag, you actually get a bit more sats and it kind of just sends it to you. So my gamer tag is MandelBuck and anybody wants to send me sats? There is weird, on our wallet there's this guy who keeps sending people sats for free. Now and then we just get like this PTDS or something, his name. He's sending two sats, I don't know why, I don't know if it's right, but I'm not complaining. So what I'm doing now is I'm just actually just, I'm putting 1,000 sats into the game, and then that will be distributed to the players based on how many coins they collect and on their positions. So I'm just gonna,

Audience: oh, are you gonna pay us? I thought you were going to pay us. I'm not. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Christian: So I'm sending Bitcoin into the game now. Oh, it doesn't like the lights. You could've got one of us to play it. I know what you've done. What you doing in the lots, Al? Okay, these are some of the cards we have. We have a Bitcoin card, we have a Bitcoin rollercoaster guy. We actually did a thing where people might know the Magical Crypto Friends podcast. It's finished now, but we've only got those guys playing. I think it's finished now but we haven't got those guys playing. I'm just going to choose a... Fix my speed a bit. You can do the piece of paper. Everybody can. I'm going to do the... I'll do this one because it's a little bit shorter. So guys, now you're on guys. So yeah, so the gamer tag is the thing before the address. So before the at. Just that, ZBD. It'll be Roger9000. Just that. 

Audience: It's name test, innit? It's name test. 

Christian: Yeah, that'll be the one, yeah. 

Audience: Oh yeah, dude! Yeah, I'm recording right now. Where have I been before? Ah! Yeah, yeah, yeah, I remember this. 

Christian: Just type a nickname in there as well. Okay, yeah. Europe, that's right, yeah.

Audience: So, so, so, both of the guys are ready with their screens. You're like behind the... What's happening? There you go. You can cut that out. 

Christian: Yeah, and just choose the car you want. Just click here. This is a trap puzzle if we don't click right on the left. Right there. Choose any car. 

Audience: So you have your car. You have your car. This is the trackpad, right on the left. Alright, so you have your car. What's happening on your screen there? Why does it look different? I'm waiting for this. He's actually the only one who's ready pretty much. 

Christian: Okay, so I'll just show you the controls. So the controls are... A is to accelerate. Yeah. The joystick is to turn, basically. You want to try and get the coins? The left trigger is to use a power up and the right trigger is to throw a coin. So we do this thing, we have bitcoin on the track and you can collect the coins and the more coins you collect the more Bitcoin you get at the end. But you can also throw the coins at other players to kind of hit them and overtake them. But then you have to spend your Bitcoin. So do you hoard the coins and get more at the end or do you try and use the coins to overtake and then you get like a bonus sats at the end? So, yeah. But anyway, A is to go forward, turn, left trigger use power-up, right trigger throw a point. Yeah. But, if you're confused, just go forward and try and get many points. I'll tell you what to do. 

MIXED AUDIO: This is good to be in the scene. Here we go. This is me. I'm gonna lose on purpose. What? Where are you going? Oh, yeah. What's the question, then? This is the... Oh, I just... The screen is lagging, so... This is insane. Ah, excuse me. Oh, you're supposed to collect the coins, don't you? Collect the coins! Yeah, I've got a French. Ah! What? What is that? This is the first place. Oh, man. Oh. The coin is coming too fast. How do you get faster dude? What is the problem? How do you get faster? You're having problem accelerating? You're the last one aren't you? You're like an old grey. I have no idea how to go fast. You're going fast now. You did something good. I don't know what I did there. I don't know. He's holding... I'm just trying to get coins, dude. Alright, okay, okay. I don't think I'm going to put this in the video, by the way. I'm not doing very well. This whole section, I don't know. Where the hell did you get all that? Right there. You can make up like advertising clothes for different companies on the site. I'm just trying to get coins, dude. I'm back to get some more points. Oh, why? What's happening? Oh, why? You're doing the most interesting commentary so far. Self-commentary. So, you won? I'm not a volunteer anyway. Ah! I got most of the money first. I just got the second. So you won? I sent to my Gamertag the wallet. So I don't have anything. Show it for the camera. Show the people How much money and bucks everything else here? Because what will happen, when everybody finishes, it will send me some more coins. So there are some coins that won't be collected on the track, and if there are any coins, it sends it to people with a game attack. Okay, okay. Yeah, so... So we just have to wait for the people here to finish, pretty much. So you can get your money, that's what's happening. We've only got this room till 8 o'clock. This game is actually available on itch at the moment, so you can actually download it. It's PC only at the moment, you can download it and basically play with friends. Everybody can pay some sats to enter and you can be friends. Mac version is coming out soon and we're actually trying to go push it to the Epic Game Stores because Steam at the moment, they don't really allow any blockchain games temporarily. They're going to change their minds from what I've heard, but they just kind of give a blanket bag to stop a lot of scams. So we're going to push to the Epic Game Stores because they seem a lot more friendly. And yeah, but ideally, you know, we want Nintendo to add Bitcoin to Mario Kart rather than us having to make a poor man's Mario Kart clone. But it just kind of shows the concept, shows how the wallet works. And yeah, I think everyone finished today? I was just going to quickly say, so I actually got a second transaction after everybody finished saying of 14 cents. And this is a coin return. So some coins weren't collected. And any coins that weren't collected, I want to send back to the players. But without the gamer tag, I would have to make another QR code for somebody to kind of scan. And maybe they've quit the game. But with the gamer tag, the server can just like, after the game is finished, just send it with you not worrying about it. So I know there are kind of streaming sats protocols coming to Lightning, there's like keysend and stuff, so we might be able to do that in a more open way, but at the moment that's one of the benefits the gamertag gives you, is we can kind of stream payments. Also, I kind of think, for games, it's okay if we centralize the sending of 14 sats, you know, it kind of makes sense.
