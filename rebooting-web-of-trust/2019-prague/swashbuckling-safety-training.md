# Introduction

I was very excited to hear that I was speaking right after someone from the Pirate Party. We're part of the Digital Credentials Effort led by MIT and 12 other major universities. We will have a whitepaper out at the end of September. I am a W3c credentials community group co-chair. Formerly CTO of Learning Machine, and architected and built blockcerts at MIT Media Lab. I like applying self-sovereing tech deliberately. I am working with Venn Agency on the future of safety training and credentialing.

# Privacy and piracy

I hadn't known about the Pirate Party. I think there's an interesting overlap.

# Emergencies

Most of us don't know what to do during emergencies, and then we panic. During the Vegas shooting, many attendees tried to exit the way they entered because they didn't know the closest exit. This led to more injuries and loss of life. I am also suffering from information overload, it's hard for me to track which stimuli you should be looking at. GPS also tends to take you to places it shouldn't. And yet, we continue to practice the same old safety practices.

# Venn Agency: Loci

Their Loci product uses a combination of tehcniques to respond to that. There's VR and AR which is one aspect. But what they do is, they first start by taking any building space and making a 3d mapping of it. Then in terms of a-- there's a backend product you use to-- the safety managers at the location can mark interesting points like evacuation routes or fire exstinguishers or emergency exits. So what they're doing is gamifying safety training and make it so that your brain is more interested in this. In the AR path, they print out QR codes to scan around and the participants go and do the game that way. They have fully VR ones too. The thing that is interesting about this is that part of it is to test hypotheses about what is the best way to get humans to take in safety information training.

After they do the training, the people get verifiable credentials. Once a certain number of employees have met the threshold requirement for safety credentials, then the whole company gets a regulatory rubber stamp automatically.
