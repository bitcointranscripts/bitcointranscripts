# Bitcoin Transcripts Repository

A home for Bitcoin transcripts used by [btctranscripts.com](https://btctranscripts.com).

This does not contain the code to run the site displaying this content, which can be found at the [bitcointranscripts.github.io](https://github.com/bitcointranscripts/bitcointranscripts.github.io) repo.

## Contribution

When creating a new directory or adding a page to an existing directory, please follow the structure like this:

```
├── _index.md
├── page-top.md
└── /level-one
    ├── _index.md
    ├── page-1-one.md
    ├── page-1-two.md
    └── /level-two
        ├── _index.md
        ├── page-2-one.md
        ├── page-2-two.md
        └── /level-three
            ├── _index.md
            ├── page-3-one.md
            ├── page-3-two.md
            └── /level-four
                ├── page-4-one.md
                └── page-4-two.md
```

Each directory requires an `_index.md` file with front matter that will reflect the name of the index page in the menu. Adding `{{< childpages >}}` as the body will ensure that all the appropriate files in that directory will be listed. (See [example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitcointranscripts/bitcointranscripts/master/advancing-bitcoin/2019/_index.md))

The file name will ideally be prefixed by the date (e.g. `2021-03-30-example-file.md`)

Each transcript is a markdown file, which requires to include the `title` and `transcript_by` in the file front matter. You can optionally add the speaker's name as well as categories and tags as strings in an array. For example:

```
---
title: Carl Dong - Reproducible Builds (2020-11-30)
transcript_by: Bryan Bishop
speaker: Carl Dong
categories: ['podcast']
tag: ['build systems']
---
```

*Note*: that it is best practice to include the date of the event in the title. (If we can gather enough meta-data, we someday intend on being able to sort transcripts by date.)

### Transcription Style

For your contributions, please use an "edited transcription" style, which can also be referred to as clean verbatim transcription. The goal of an edited transcription is to preserve the meaning of a text without paraphrasing. Stammering, filler words such as 'like' or 'you know', and unnecessary non-verbal communication can be omitted. Strike a balance between completeness and readability. 

Oftentimes, audience questions and comments will be inaudible. Feel free to only indicate when an audience member is speaking if their audio is not clear. 

## i18n

Spanish and French are [configured by default](https://github.com/bitcointranscripts/bitcointranscripts.github.io/blob/master/config.toml#L11) for [btctranscripts.com](https://btctranscripts.com).

To add a new spanish translation, for example, you need to add an `_index.es.md` file with the proper Spanish title. Then add the transcript file with the appropriate `.es.md` , e.g. `2021-03-30-example-file.es.md`.

This is the same for French (`.fr`).

If you'd like to propose a new language, you can do so by modifying the [site config](https://github.com/bitcointranscripts/bitcointranscripts.github.io/blob/master/config.toml) (this is another [repo](https://github.com/bitcointranscripts/bitcointranscripts.github.io)).

We'd love transcripts in other languages so we've made every effort to make i18n as easy as possible.
