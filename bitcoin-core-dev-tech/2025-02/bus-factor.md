Many maintainers from 2019 are retired or gone.

Half a dozen OG devs left.

Code owners (dropped, probably not worth reviving)

Git blame works

Few people have deep and wide knowledge

Some people look at all things.

Out of band with OGs.

## Examples
  
- Header sync (?)
  - New steps added recently, but nobody has big picture.
  - Check point removal?
    - Do after release, hopefully someone notices it and brings up objections
- Test are knowledgle
- GUI tests
- Windows unit tests (?)
- REST

Bus factor: subtrees

When people disappear those areas of code and functionality freeze.

Competitor client, which might be good, unless it sneaks in an evil softfork.

## Solutions:

- backup meta data
- education
- fashion (leading figure works on it, many new devs follow)
