## what was your experience as a new contributor?

- Is there an onboarding, currently?
  - chaincode seminars, onboarding to bitcoin core document
  - obbc useful for current engs as well, slightly out of date

- Started by jumping in and reverse engineering, not a great experience
- New contributors are planes with bullet holes in the wings, not in the
  fusilage
- There is a lot of fallout from the people just reading material, i.e. very few
  convert to writing code
- Mindset is also important, not necessarily technical chops. I have the
  mindset, but I need structure to get started
- Some people might not be able to do it on their own, but with a helping hand
  will succeed
- BTCFOSS was super helpful as a "helping hand" to get started

## what else has helped?

- Is there a mentorship program for the project? Brink fellowship is an example
- Weekly meetings, easy access
- too much mentorship can also be bad, good to grind and push through, learning
  on your own can be helpful
- Working with a mentor as a reviewer, the author taught me but also was
  receptive to my critique
- kind of a safe place to practice critiquing others works
- random exploration was helpful to understanding the code, but ran into
  undocumented things often
- required human in the loop to learn a lot of things

## what was difficult?

- very different from other open source projects
- different priorities, unclear what is objectively a good change
- online interaction can be difficult
- as a new contributor it can be difficult to understand the intent of a NACK
- the best experiences ive had are when I've had the confidence to be wrong
- often times i realise this in reflection, wish I would speak up sooner and
  push through the fear of being wrong in public
- understanding being wrong isn't necessarily a bad thing, and being wrong sooner
  is better
- we should document better bad ideas
- being comfortable being wrong is a benefit to the person and benefit to
  document bad decisions in the project

## things that can help

- not just reviewing the code as of today but the history of the code on a
  particular topic, e.g., the orphanage, benchmarking
- understanding the context and build up to how a thing is today is often
  piecemeal across git blame, issues, old PRs, irc-logs

## how to help newcomers pick an area of focus

- old prs were very helpful
- the mentors also need to know what to work on and be able to convey this in a
  convincing way
- many people have lots of ideas they are really excited about, but have never
  concretely communicated
- how to find things people are excited about, half baked ideas, can be great
  candidates to try something
- pushing a project forward understanding it might fail is still a huge value
  add
- the contributor learns, the mentor realises their half baked idea was bad, it
  becomes documentation of what not to try
- having low confidence that an idea is actually good can be demotivating
- conceptual feedback before implementing something can be very helpful
- but also i dont want to contribute to something that might get in but will end
  up the in the graveyard of "probably shouldnt have done that"

## how do newcomers know their interests are good interests?

- sometimes a small idea can seem appealing, but becomes super complex as you
  dig in
- some people thrive on depth on a narrow subject, sometimes need to try
  different areas to find an area of focus
