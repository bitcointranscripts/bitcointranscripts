## How to lead them?

- What makes people shy away from the topic? It shouldn't be about command, it
  should be more about setting goals, provide space for people to contribute.
- It bleeds down to providing motivation.
- Leadership is both technical expertise, and managing people.
- One of the problems is hard to get people to review wallet code, even from
  working group members.
- While cmake, multiprocess, kernel have more participation.
- Critical mass is important. More activity, from multiple people, attracts more
  review.
- Splitting things up helps up. Grinding it down to sand.
- Giving people things to do makes them participate. Sadly, for some things,
  everything is already written.
- Writing blog posts, sharing with just the working group is helpful. There are
  non-obnoxious tools. You don't have to go to twitter.
- And cmake/multiprocess/kernel, doing workshops helped. Meeting in person.
  Scheduling what to in the next half year.
- Was done for silent payments, but that was very early. Just the BIP, no
  implementation work yet.
- For multiprocess, people flew to meet in person. Had discussions there, was
  useful.
- Having a goal is important. Leadership is repeating the goal over and over
  again.
- For multiprocess, it lingered for years. But it seems to have changed, Sv2
  stuff is recent.
- Meeting in person helps, faster feedback. Review in person. For some projects,
  slow and steady progress, data, reiterating goals at coredev, for cluster
  mempool.
- Do we want a session on BDB removal? Shouldn't be deleting too much. What are
  the risks?
- We didn't touch yet, the merge window. Very culturally different. We do this a
  bit, with the bar of review changes over the time, and the feature freeze.
- How did it work out for cmake? The only drawback was that when changing
  things, people complained when things changed. It resulted in feeling more
  confident. We did see a drop off in review. We should make it more
  interesting? Change build system every time?

Failed projects?

- As a champion you have to accept defeat from time to time. Some of the things
  that have failed in the past was due to losing critical mass, and the champion
  didn't do much afterwards.
- Listening to feedback and adapting is good.
- Shifting active contributors is a part.

## ChatGPT summary

Hereâ€™s a more concise summary

- Leadership - Effective leadership involves setting clear goals and creating
  space for contributions rather than commanding. Motivation and technical
  expertise are key.
- Participation - Getting people to review code is challenging, but splitting
  tasks and providing clear responsibilities can help. In-person meetings and
  workshops (e.g., for multiprocess) boost engagement.
- Communication - Repeating goals and sharing progress through blog posts or
  working group discussions helps maintain focus. In-person reviews offer faster
  feedback.
- Challenges - Risks around BDB removal were discussed, and cultural
  differences affect review processes. Changing things (like the build system)
  can lead to more confidence, though some resistance is inevitable.

Overall, clear goals, active participation, and strong communication are
essential for leading big projects.
