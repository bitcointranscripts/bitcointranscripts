- One contributor delved into the code, found an issue, and started going from
  there.
- One contributor found things he could contribute straightaway given his
  expertise, like CI and CMake and ended up meeting other contributors and
  started working with them.
- One contributor looked at oldish issues that may need someone to take care of
  and thinks one of the issues is understanding what needs to be done, and
  “wasting” time working on small things that you may be familiar with but that
  are not really important.
- One contributor found a list of things to fix, and started from there, finding
  that later projects were not as satisfying as at the beginning, where he could
  find exciting obvious improvements.
- One contributor came from a more theoretical perspective, thinking it from the
  problem space, and took me a while to really start contributing given they
  were not familiar with the language. Started by looking into an area of the
  codebase they were familiar with and documenting. Working closely with other
  contributors in the same area helped a lot (small review clubs).
- One contributor started with the functional test framework and ended up
  working on the wallet based on the faster review cycle. He found that his work
  was more meaningful because people were actually paying attention to it.
- A shared feeling across the board seems to be having people you admire/you
  look up to, the willingness to learn and understand better the project.
  Validation/attention/kindness mattered.
- There is an interest from new contributors to know what people would like to
work on even if they are not going to work on themselves. A list would be nice.
People could vote on what they find interesting/uninteresting. Voicing opinions
on what is actually not interesting. Worth spending time on. Not a good idea
(ignore vs NACK).
- Is it a reasonable expectation for everyone to figure out what they should be
  working on. - The freedom is good, and something some of us value. But others
  may need more guidance. The lack of a clear goal/leader makes it hard for
  newcomers to know what to focus on. More experienced contributors can guide
  newcomers, but what is interesting boils down to personal opinion, and you
  don’t want to point someone towards a goose chase.
- In the absence of clear leaders people tend to follow more established
  contributors opinions. This is good to get a sense of direction but plays
  against them voicing their own opinions if they disagree with what they are
  told/pointed out to.
