- AJ's recent publication "[Bitcoin Forking Guide](https://ajtowns.github.io/bfg/)" used as a reference in this discussion

- Five primary steps/phases:
  - Academic / R&D
  - Prototyping
  - Get it to industry - demonstrate use-cases
  - Investors - you have the technicals, make sure everyone's opinions are expressed and heard
  - Merge/Activation

- Lessons from taproot: Did we ask these questions for taproot?
  - More practical attention to industry adoption required? No efforts towards specific implementations, although there was general attention from industry  
  - No tests in the BIP

- Not widely established that covenants are a good or bad idea? Question of recursion behaviors in combination with other proposals?
- Concerns around MEV  - open questions
- Some (pleasant) surprise how much participation there has been in the covenants wiki
