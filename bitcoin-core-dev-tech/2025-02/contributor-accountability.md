## What is accountability?

* Do what you say you're going to do
* Accountable to who funds you
* Accountable to the Bitcoin Core project as a whole
* Accountable to the project you worked on into the future

Eventually we discussed the accountability comes down to ownership of a
particular project or area of the codebase.

There was an observation that we don't have enough resources to be accountable
for all the things we need to be accountable for. Maybe limiting scope would
help count down on the number of things to be accountable for.

There is lack of explicit definition of who should be accountable for what, as
well as what accountability actually means. This can result in the bystander
effect where it is easy to ignore an issue and have someone else step up.

The bystander effect for accountability could be solved by some sort of
assignment of ownership or leadership over certain projects or components. Maybe
this is as simple as the leader of the working group.

But having some sort of title doesn't work without some agreement on what is
required of such a role. So coming up with a list could be helpful.

## Accountability list:

* Setting goals and scope
* What is in the release
* Respond to inquiries and PRs in this area of the codebase
* Adequate review
* Maintenance

Accountability doesn't mean you have to be the person executing on all the work.
You can find other resources, ask for help, etc.

## Enforcement?:

* The title itself helps socially enforce accountability
* But in open source it’s hard to call out lack of accountability
* Formalizing a list of accountability within a code area makes it easier to
  call out missing accountability since there is a list to reference

Risks:

* If we add responsibility and accountability to people taking on projects, it
  could dissuade people from championing things

## Additional Recorded Notes

1. **Caring About the Releases More Than Individual Code**
   - Prioritize overall project success over individual contributions.

2. **Ownership & Maintenance**
   - Contributors should maintain the features they implement.
   - Starting work and merging code is not enough; accountability extends beyond initial contribution.

3. **Do What You Intend to Do**
   - Implement features, then maintain them.

4. **Sub-Module Leadership**
   - Leaders are responsible for deciding what goes into a component.
   - Leaders do not necessarily have to be maintainers.
   - There should be a clear signal to maintainers.

5. **Project Thinking & Accountability**
   - Leaders should resolve outstanding issues before feature freeze.
   - If unresolved, the feature should be removed from the milestone.

6. **Lack of Accountability**
   - Many voice opinions, but few take responsibility.
   - A common issue: "A lot of people are around, but no one will do it."
   - We cannot expect accountability for everything—e.g., Windows support is being shipped, but no one is working on it.

7. **Scoped Goals & Responsibilities**
   - Some tasks are difficult to assign a leader and accountable person.
   - If you own a component, you are responsible for engaging in working groups that touch that component.
   - Some are contributing, some are not, but they are expected to.

8. **Trust & Leadership Issues**
   - What if leaders have their own proposals?
   - Trust issues regarding leadership responsibilities.
   - Owners decide what should be included, but they are not always accountable for execution.
   - It sometimes feels like we are "reinventing charity."

9. **Governance & Decision-Making**
   - One lead maintainer calling all the shots might not be ideal.
   - Internal accountability within Bitcoin Core needs improvement.
   - Even when people voice opinions, nothing happens.
   - A formal process would make decision-making easier.
   - Decentralized decision-making should be structured and explicit.

10. **Next Steps**
   - Establish clearer accountability.
   - Enforce maintenance responsibilities.
   - Improve decision-making structures.

### Wrap Up

- **We should not be static—let's try new approaches.**
- **Make arguments explicit to improve decentralized decision-making.**
