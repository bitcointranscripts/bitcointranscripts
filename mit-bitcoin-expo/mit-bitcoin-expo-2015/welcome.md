Hey. All y'all ready? Alright, awesome. My name is Jing, I am president of the Wossley Bitcoin Club.

Last year we had over 500 attendees and we had the launch of the MIT Bitcoin project.

What's different this year? We have two days full of speakers. We are trying to get more academic so that we can dive into the heart of cryptocurrency. We have Charlie Lee, the creator of Litecoin. He leads the product engineering team at Coinbase currently. Please join me in welcoming Charlie Lee.
