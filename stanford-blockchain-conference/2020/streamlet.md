((.... stream went offline in the other room, had to catch up.))

Show you new consensus protocol called streamlet.
We think it is remarkably simple intuitive.
This is quite a bold claim, hopefully the protocol will speak for itself

Incredibly subtle, hard to implement in practice.
We want to take this reputation and sweep it out the door.

Jump right in.
First model the consensus problem.
Motivating simplicity as a goal.
Spend the bulk of talk, line by line through the protocol
By the end, you will be able to understand it and describe it.

Never have I ever been able to understand a consensus protocol in 30 minutes, I hope we will get there.

Consensus
Fundamental algorithm question people solve
How do we get agreement
A version of this problem

Reach agreement on sequence.

We have a set of processes. Very much in the permission setting.
Aren’t blockchains my def permissionless.
Proof of stake.

Modern protocols

Permission consensus relevant to blockchain research today

Problem statement

First consistency
Everyone wants to see the same chain

Everyone wants to see the same chain.


Introducing adversaris
Some subset of users are malicious.

On top of that network might be flaky.

On example what if someone


Difficult to achieve.

We don’t know which side is malicious.

Difficulty in solving.

Can we eliminate subtle voting rules that seem to be inherent to every consensus protocol.

Motivating simpler consensus protocol.

Goal
simplest possible easy to understand consensus protocol.

Assumptions.

Streamlet

Epochs
Processes have local clocks, and run in synchronized epochs of 1 set of epochs.

2nd assumption
Every epoch has a leader, a single leader known by all.

Definitions before meat of the protocol.

Block
Notarized block
Piece of the blockchain where all of the blocks are notarized

The streamlet protocol
In every epoch...
Leader- creates a new block
Leader choose longest notarized chain
Voters- signs the first block they see from the correct leader from the epoch they are in
If and only if it extends the longest chain.

... Really, really simple. This is the meat of the finalization. This is our entire protocol. A leader proposes a block, extends the longest chain, then a voter votes on the block if it is indeed on the longest chain. Once he sees a few in a row, then he can finalize the entire chain. That's it.

...
