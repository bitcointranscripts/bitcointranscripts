##  tech news is a lot

 Tech news and it just keeps coming in us all over us. It just keeps coming. There's just so cool there's so many technical things that absolutely hurt there. Oh, are you on me to do something about it?

##  M2 Pro, M2 Max, HomePod 2

 Apple has unveiled new MacBook Pros and Mac Minis powered by M2SOCs, including new chips thankfully named M2 Pro and M2 Max instead of M2 excessive or something. M2 Outlandish The 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pros perform around 20 to 30% faster than their M1-drive counterparts, at least according to Apple's graphs and can be configured with up to 96 gigabytes of RAM if you're Elon Musk. There's also M2 and M2 Pro equipped Mac Minis so I can get my mom a discounted M1 version soon. But if you watched Apple's 18-minute video keenly looking for any sign of the company's mixed reality headset, keep waiting. It'll probably still show up in June, although will be waiting longer for Apple's lighter AR glasses, which have been delayed in favor of making a cheaper headset for the Quest 2 crowd. But that wasn't actually everything that Apple officially announced this week. There's a new full-size HomePod 2 for $2.99 after Apple pulled the old one because no-am bought it. It's apparently better even though it has less physical speakers inside it, but that might be to make room for unknown sensors. Like the secret temperature and humidity sensor that Apple just activated in the HomePod Mini. People bought it without even knowing it was in there. What else is in there? There's hiding the big source. Anyways, you can use two of the new big HomePod as stereo speakers for your Apple TV, but can you use it to accept the new terms and conditions after your TV update? Your TV update? Your TV update? Your TV update? Your TV update? Your TV update? Your TV update? Your TV update? Your TV update? Your TV update? Your TV update?" Your TV update? Your TV update?

##  Apple TV terms, France fines Apple

 Yeah, this week a tweet by Chris, I don't know how to read his handle, went viral after he was prompted by his Apple TV to accept its new TOS using basically any other Apple device, which he didn't have a situation that is apparently inconceivable to Apple. What do you mean you don't have more than you don't even have an iPad? You don't need another device to set up the Apple TV. So this was confusing. Thankfully, there is a workaround involving signing out from the Apple TV's settings, but Apple would really prefer you to have an iOS device on hand, because otherwise how is it going to collect your user data without your consent? That's right, France just find Apple a whole $8.5 million A.K.A. The amount of cash it gives its kids to spend at the corner store. For that whole debacle from a few months ago, where it was found that Apple's personalized ads toggle in iOS did absolutely nothing in most of Apple's own apps. Because what happens on your iPhone stays on your iPhone, it's just you have to understand that Apple servers are part of your iPad...

##  Getty Images sues Stability AI

 phone. And in non-appal news, Gettie Images has sued Stability AI, the maker of popular AI Art tool-stable diffusion in the second major lawsuit over what the heck we're going to do about the copyright thing now that art can be absorbed mixed around and reconstituted like a Freaks Star Trek Transporter accident. Gettie Images says Stability AI copied and processed millions of images protected by copyright without a license, although Gettie CEO Craig Peter said they're not seeking monetary damages, they just want to establish a precedent for this kind of thing. And yeah, sure, if people pay for licenses as part of that as a matter of conscience, then fine. And to be clear, we do need that precedent and education and transparency regarding this AI stuff because people are freaking out and thinking Adobe is definitely training AI with your Photoshop files, which the company has denied. But was that press released written by chatGPT? How can you know? I don't know, maybe we can burn through a bunch of these lawsuits really quick. We should just use that AI lawyer bot. Do process just takes so much time. I could be eating deadly, thanks for the topic.

##  Microsoft layoffs

 In a much too common trend, Microsoft announced its laying off 10,000 workers around 4.5% of the company's workforce. But the move is attracting even more criticism than normal since it comes one year to the day after Microsoft announced plans to acquire Activision Blizzard for $69.000. The layoffs might make more sense if Microsoft had paid that money already, but the deal hasn't gone through, and it might not ever, if regulators get their way. And then what are you going to do? Higher the poor workers back? I don't understand how businesses work. Hard work?

##  Dell CAMM becoming laptop standard

 Dells once controversial cam laptop memory standard has come full circle. The industry group overseeing memory standards, Jedec, I'm assuming that. Announced the informally adopt cam as the next ram module standard for notebooks. Jedec says they may modify the design before releasing the spec in the second half of 2023, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't feel dumb for doubting Dells good intentions. We really should trust tech and Beckham.

##  RIP Stadia

 more. Google Stadium will be well and truly dead as of 1159 p.m. Pacific time today, January 18th, just over three years after the service was announced. People will know doubt be talking about how Google announces and then cancel services, but maybe we're thinking about this the wrong way. Maybe Stadium lived a proper life. Three years is a long time. Would you want to be in prison for three years? Not at the only option for entertainment with Stadium.

##  Another Atlas robot video

 Boston Dynamics has again attempted to intimidate the world, with a new video of its Atlas Robot, not only parkour parkouring around a construction site, but also making its own bridge with a wooden plank and throwing a heavy bag of tools at a human worker. And then it has the audacity to do a twisty flip-miggy off of a box and pump its metal limb in a disquieting mockery of a human person. Boston Dynamics, this will not end well. Why don't you just act like a normal company and sell home pods or something? Pat or something! Pat or something! Pat or something! or something.

##  War Thunder forums leaks info again

 And yet more classified military information has been revealed on the War Thunder Forms by people who apparently care more about the accuracy of their game than about national security. To back up an interesting detail they found out about the F-16 fighter jet, a user posted a specifications document that was still classified as restricted. The user might be at risk of facing 10 years in prison and or a massive fine, but honestly that's worth it. To know that people aren't flying a virtual plane equipped with a wrong type of missiles, that's unacceptable. And this is a wrong time to continue this episode because it's over. Come back on Friday for more tech news or face 10 years in prison and or a massive fine. Alright!
