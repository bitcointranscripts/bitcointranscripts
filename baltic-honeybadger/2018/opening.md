Okay guys, we're going to start in five minutes. So stay here. She is going to introduce speakers and help everyone out. Thanks everyone for coming. It's a huge crowd this year. I wanted to make a few technical announcements. First of all, just remember that we should be excellent to each other. We have people from all over the world here. We don't care from where you're from, what your height is, we don't care how old are you, we don't care about those things- be excellent to each other. The other thing is, the afterparty starts at 6pm. Please wear the badges for the afterparty. Unless you have them, they aren't going to let you in. You need to wear the badges. Last year we had a few guys from Australia brought some beers. I was supposed to do the same this year, but we have two guys from New Zealand if you guys could identify yourselves. How long did you fly? 22 hours. 42 hours? Okay. Was it business or economy? Don't tell me. So, this is pretty much it for the technical announcements. I would like to say a few words about our organizers. They did a great job here on sighting Riga and finding the space. You probably remembe rlast year we had the second day at the co-working space. Let's give them a round of applause as well, they're doing a great job here. Alright, so, Dominic, would you like to say a few words?

Thanks so much for having me. I'm honored to help at this conference. My name is Dominique. I'm from the Bitcoin Association. I will be introducing the speakers and say a few sentences about them.
